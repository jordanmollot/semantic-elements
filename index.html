    <h2>What are semantic elements?</h2>
    <p>
        Semantic elements are HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer. Their content is clearly defined as opposed to non-semantic elements. Semantic elements improve the accessibility, searchability and internationalization of your website. They also allow for easier collaboration as they assist other programmers with understanding the structure of your website.

    <h3>Examples of Semantic Elements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></li>
      </ul>

        Semantic elements were introduced in HTML5!

        <h2>Brief History of HTML</h2>
        <p>
            The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary for all XML languages, because without it, interoperability between applications would be impossible. You'll learn more about the differences between HTML and XHTML in Unit 2.

            Most pages on the Web today were built using either HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0. However, in recent years, the W3C (in collaboration with another organization, the WHATWG), has been working on a brand new version of HTML, HTML5. Currently (2011), HTML5 is still a draft specification, and is not yet an official standard. However, it is already widely supported by browsers and other web-enabled devices, and is the way of the future. Therefore, HTML5 is the primary language taught in this course.
